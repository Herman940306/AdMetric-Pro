# GitHub & Documentation Standards

- **Intent:** Every file in this repository is a marketing asset for potential clients.
- **Commit Messages:** Must follow "Conventional Commits" format (e.g., `feat: add data validation for Meta CSVs`). No slang or lazy messages.
- **Documentation:** Every Python function must have a Google-style Docstring explaining inputs, outputs, and business value.
- **README:** The README must be written for Business Owners, not just devs. Focus on "Problem solved" and "Time saved."
- **Privacy:** Never include client names, API keys, or real marketing data in any file pushed to GitHub. Always use `mock_data/` and `.gitignore`.
